This demo shows a very basic example how the library can be used.

The demo creates 2 machines, i.e. machine_1 and machine_2. machine_1 sends 10
numbers to machine_2, which adds them and returns the total.

This demo shows how to use the library and how to send and receive messages
between machine instances.
